This project implements a machine learning-based brain tumor detection system using logistic regression and SVM classifiers. It processes MRI images by loading, resizing, and normalizing them before training the models. The dataset is structured into "Training" and "Testing" sets, with classes such as "no tumor" and "pituitary tumor." The model achieves predictions through image classification and visualizes results for both normal and tumor-affected cases. Future improvements can include deep learning approaches like CNNs for higher accuracy
